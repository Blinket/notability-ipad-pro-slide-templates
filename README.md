# Slide templates for the Notability App on iPad Pro

Three templates for creating slides in the Notability App. The screen
format works on an iPad Pro (24x17cm).

The following styles are provided:

- blank paper
- grid paper
- dotted paper

All three variants come in a one-page and a multi-page template (that
is, 50 pages).

You can import these into Notability and then use them as templates
when creating ad-hoc lecture or presentations slides. When using the
multi-page templates, simply only export the page range you have
actually used (and this assumes your presentation has at most 50
slides).
